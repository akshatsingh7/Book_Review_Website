                <h3>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas" by John Boyne is a poignant and haunting novel set during World War II. It tells the story of Bruno, an eight-year-old boy whose family moves from Berlin to a house near a concentration camp, where his father is the commandant. Unaware of the camp's true nature, Bruno befriends Shmuel, a Jewish boy of the same age who lives on the other side of the camp's fence.
                
                Through their innocent friendship, the novel explores themes of innocence, prejudice, and the devastating impact of the Holocaust. Boyne's narrative is simple yet powerful, seen through the eyes of a child who does not fully grasp the horrors unfolding around him. The story's heartbreaking conclusion underscores the tragedy of the Holocaust and the innocence lost during this dark period in history.
                
                "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking novel that highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in a world marred by hatred and division.    <br><br>
